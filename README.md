In this repository I will practice source control and it will contain the code of a solution that had the most impact on my software development career.

## Initial commit
Insert Water sort puzzle solution
The aim of the game is to solve the puzzle by rearranging the bottles so each bottle contains only one color. I solved the problem by using a stack, array list and Watersort class.
